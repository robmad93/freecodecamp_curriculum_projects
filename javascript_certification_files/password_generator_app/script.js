/*
User Stories:

You should create a function called generatePassword that takes a parameter, indicating the length of generated password. You can name the parameter whatever you like.
Your function should return a string which represents a randomly generated password. You should use the following string and different Math methods to help you return a new string with random characters in it: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*().
You should define a variable called password and assign it the result of calling the generatePassword function with a numeric argument that represents the desired password length.
You should have a console.log that logs a single string made by concatenating the message Generated password: and the password variable separated by a space.

function generatePassword(num) {
  const characters = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*()";
  let password = "";
  for (let i = 0; i < num; i++) {
    password += characters[Math.floor(Math.random() * (characters.length))];
  }
  return password;
}

let password = generatePassword(9);
console.log(`Generated password: ${password}`);
