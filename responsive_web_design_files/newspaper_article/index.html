        Scenes of wild celebration erupted across County Clare yesterday when
        the sun appeared for a full five minutes shortly after noon.
        Eyewitnesses report at least three people saying “it’s fierce mild
        altogether” while one daring individual in Ennis was seen leaving the
        house without a coat, only to regret it deeply moments later.

        Local experts have confirmed that the phenomenon, known scientifically
        as “winter fatigue,” represents a coping strategy adopted by individuals
        to deal with the uneventful and often bleak period that follows the
        Christmas holidays. Meanwhile, shops reported a spike in the sale of
        sunglasses, followed immediately by refunds, as heavy clouds returned
        and normal service resumed. At press time, residents had agreed it was
        “still bright enough out” despite standing in near darkness.
