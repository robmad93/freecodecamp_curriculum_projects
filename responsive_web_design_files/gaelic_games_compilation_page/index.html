        <h1>Gaelic Games</h1>
        <p>Ireland is a country with a rich culture. Ireland even has its own sports, collectively referred to as the Gaelic games. While these sports are primarily played in Ireland, clubs continue to be established abroad, promoting these games to a wider, international community.</p>

                Gaelic football
            </h2>
            <p>
                Gaelic football is a dynamic Irish team sport, controlled by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), played with a round ball on a large rectangular grass pitch with H-shaped goalposts. It is the most popular of the Gaelic games and is widely played across Ireland. It combines elements of soccer and rugby, with players advancing the ball via carrying, bouncing, kicking, and hand-passing to score points or goals.

            <p>
                Hurling is an ancient, fast-paced Irish team sport governed by the GAA, played with a stick (hurley) and a small ball (sliotar) to score by hitting the ball over or under H-shaped goalposts, blending skills from field hockey and lacrosse for a dynamic, high-scoring game deeply rooted in Irish culture.

            <h2>Gaelic handball</h2>
            <p>Gaelic Handball is a traditional Irish sport, governed by the GAA, where players use their hands (or gloved fists) to hit a small ball against one, three, or four walls, aiming to make it rebound so an opponent can't return it legally, similar to squash but with hand-strikes. There are four main types: 4-Wall (40x20), 1-Wall, 60x30 (Softball/Big Alley), and Hardball, with 4-Wall and 1-Wall being international, while 60x30 and Hardball are classic Irish codes. It's a fast-paced game of skill, played in singles or doubles, focusing on strategic returns to score points. </p>
